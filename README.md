# Stellar_Classification
The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built which as a result lead to building a model that can easily classify between different stars using a powerful telescope.

For this Project SVM(SVC) was used to build machine learning model to classify stars based on their spectral characteristics.
